# Clot Ecommerce

This is a Flutter mobile application basead on a [Figma Ecommerce UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1233130764703685276) by Emmanuel Nwankwo. This is my first Flutter project which I started with the objective to apply the knowledge recently acquired during a Flutter course by [Alura](https://alura.com.br).

## Getting Started

Firstly this project relies on a back-end service which you can check [here](https://github.com/willperes/clot_ecommerce_api). This API provides the data needed to run the application, such as category and product data. More info on how to use it on it's repository.

## How to Use 

**Step 1:**

Clone this repo by using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willperes/clot_ecommerce.git
```

**Step 2:**

Go to project root and execute the following command in the console to get the required dependencies: 

```bash
flutter pub get 
```

**Step 3:**

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run
```
